# prework-study-guide

## Description
A study guide for my UofT Bootcamp!
This webpage has been created to enhance the study process in the UofT Coding Bootcamp. It is the first step in a long way to becoming a Full Stack web developer. 

This project contains the essential matters which has to start this path. It is a Study guide for beginners.

As a beginner web developer, knowing the correct way to get coding knowledge takes a lot of work and is very difficult. This Guide provides a proper and easy way to learn to code. 

During the process, I noticed every detail and procedure to build a website with several languages such as HTML, CSS and Javascript. Also, I used GitHub to create branches and recorded every change in my code.  

## Installation
